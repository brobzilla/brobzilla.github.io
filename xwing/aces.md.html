**Aces High**
![](../images/xwing.jpg)

Pilots undergo difficult training exercises to develop their skills, and even veteran pilots still frequently participate in drills to help rookies learn the ropes or keep their own instincts sharp...


# Synopsis 
In this scenario, two to eight players each use only one ship as they compete in a battle royale to score the most points by shooting down the most enemies.  Destroyed ships return to play each round, keeping everyone playing for the duration of the game.

# Scenario Setup
Play Area
:	 3’ x 3’ ![Place four hyperspace markers as indicated ]("../images/hyperspacesetup.png")

Obstacles
:	Any 6

Establish Play Area
:	Place four hyperspace markers as indicated 

Placing Forces
:	Starting with the first player and proceeding in initiative order, each player places their ship within range 1 of any board edge and beyond range 2 of each other ship.

# Scenario Rules

Preparing for Batte
:	The ship point maximum for this Aces High event will be chosen by a vote from the community.

Possible point levels:
- Lightweight: 50 squad points
- Snub Fighter: 75 squad points
- Elite: 100 squad points
- Heavyweight: 125 squad points
- Other: Alternate squad point value not listed above.

First Hit
:	After a ship performs an attack, if the defender was at full health and suffered damage, the attacking ship’s player scores 1 ![]("../images/point.png" width=10) point.

Shot Confirmed
:	After a ship performs an attack, if the defender was destroyed, the attacking ship’s player scores 2 ![]("../images/point.png" width=10) points plus all  ![]("../images/point.png" width=10) points on the defender’s ship card (remove them from the defender’s ship card when they are scored).  Then place 1 ![]("../images/point.png" width=10) point on the attacking ship’s card.

Stay in the Fight
:	If a ship flees, remove all ![]("../images/point.png" width=10) points from its ship card. Its player loses 1 ![]("../images/point.png" width=10) point, plus ![]("../images/point.png" width=10) points equal to the number of ![]("../images/point.png" width=10) points removed this way.

Restore Ships (Start of Round)
:	Starting with the first player, each player with no ship in play rolls 1 attack die, and then restores their destroyed ship, placing it back in play with its rear guides at any position on one of the hyperspace markers matching the symbol rolled.  If it cannot be placed this way at any of the matching positions without overlapping another ship, that ship’s player places it anywhere in the play area at range 0 of a board edge (not overlapping another ship) instead.

Time’s Up (End of Round)
:	If any squad has scored 6 or more ![]("../images/point.png" width=10) points, the game ends. Then each player scores all ![]("../images/point.png" width=10) points on their ship’s card.

Scoring
:	The player with the most ![]("../images/point.png" width=10) points wins!

# HOUSE RULES:
- The **Lone Wolf** Upgrade is off limits.
- The **Darth Vader** Crew Card is off limits.
- Ships that have a total health of 10+ will be subject to half points.  (i.e. A player who inflicts half damage or more to this ship will receive 1 point.)
- Ships that have sustained damage (but have not yet taken damage from an opponent) are still subject to the First Hit rule.
- Initiative order will be randomized at the end of each round by use of a number pull system.  (i.e. If two players have an initiative 5 ship, the player who pulled the lowest number activates their ship first.)

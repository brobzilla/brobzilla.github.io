		**Access**

Access is a social strategy game where your goal is to get people to give you access to the next round of play. To compare it, in Survivor youâ€™re voting people out and need a majority of people to do so. In Access you are voting people in and it only takes 1 person to keep you safe!

Challenge 1: Poison

Each player picks another player to poison, killing them off.  The last two teams with a person alive will win and gain access to the next round.  The teams of the third and fourth to last players alive will be up for elimination and must gain access from someone on their team.

Here is how a round will work. 
=============================
1. To start the game you will be randomly divided into teams. The teams then will compete to earn Access to the next round while the losing team will have to eliminate someone.
1. The winning team will also get to vote though. Except they wonâ€™t vote to eliminate someone from their own team, they will be voting to BLOCK someoneâ€™s vote on the losing team.
1. The losing team will then cast votes for who to give access to the next round on their team but will not be able to give access to themselves. Whoever had their vote BLOCKED will not know and will submit their vote to give access to someone but that person will never receive it making them more vulnerable to be eliminated. 

Each round only 1 person will be left without access to the next round and will be eliminated. All is not lost for them though as they will have 2 opportunities to get back in the game (at the final â€” and at the final -), a chance to be on the jury that will decide the winner of the game, and other ways of influencing the game (secret secrets).

TL;DR
=====
So each round will work in that simple 3 step process. 

1. Competition for access and power
1. Winning team will vote to block the vote of someone on the losing team
2. The losing team will vote to give access to people on their own team with one person being eliminated.

There will be some time after Step 1 to strategize. And Steps 2 & 3 will actually happen at the same time.

This is the first time this game is being played with people! I have simulated this game several times but itâ€™s never been played by people before. I also created this game probably about a decade ago and Iâ€™ve always wanted to play it with real people. My birthday is this Sunday so thank you all for the perfect birthday present this year! I encourage you to do your best to break this game if you want, I donâ€™t think youâ€™ll be able to though.

Disclaimers
===========
The point of this game is to have fun and have more points of contact. To meet new people and stay in touch with people you know. With that being said, I would not like to have this game come up as a bad topic at my churchâ€™s elders meeting if you know what I mean. However, please do not take it personally when you get eliminated. This is a player elimination game so everyone but 1 person must lose. 


Pretty much everyone in this game is either part of my church or knows someone who is part of it. This is a game of meeting new people though so please try to talk to new people and include them in your strategies. For those of you not part of our church, you will probably have to work a little harder to make connections with people but I have faith in you ðŸ˜€

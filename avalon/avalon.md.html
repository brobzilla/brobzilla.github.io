Character Reference
==============================================================
GOOD
----
Merlin
:	is the leader of all GOOD characters and will know who all of the apparent evil players are, with the exception of Mordred! Merlin must subtly use his influence to sway the GOOD players to join together and conquer EVIL.

Morgaine
:	will be able to choose someone each round (with the exception of round 1, so beginning after round 2) who went on the quest. Morgaine will be informed of whether or not that person was trying to fail or succeed the quest!

Lancelot
:	gets 2 votes when choosing to Approve or Reject a quest.

Gwenivere
:	is a shady good character. She is the 1 good character that will appear as evil to Merlin. He must figure out who she as to not mistake her for one of the EVIL characters. She also will know who Lancelot is.

Percival
:	will know who Merlin and Morgana are but will NOT know which one is which, and will have to figure that out for himself.

Patricius
:	may choose someone after every round (with the exception of round 1, so beginning after round 2) and that person's role will be revealed to him!

EVIL
----
Mordred
:	is the leader of the EVIL players. He will not be known by Merlin. (Hence why Merlin shouldn't tell anyone their role because he could be telling it to EVIL) He also gets 2 Approve or Reject votes.

Morgana
:	appears as Merlin if Patricius looks at her role AND appears as Merlin to Percival.

Assassin
:	is one of the scariest players in the game even though she does not have any special abilities during the game... After the game has concluded, if GOOD has won, she has 1 guess at who Merlin is... If she is correct, the EVIL players still win. (HENCE WHY EVERYONE WANTS TO KEEP THEIR ROLE A SECRET!)

Oberon
:	is a wild card EVIL player. Oberon will not know who the other EVIL players are and they will not know who Oberon is. (All other evil characters will know who each other are)

Extras
------
With 12 players, these 2 characters are added:

Igraine
:	is EVIL whose votes will always show as "Success" to Morgaine!

King Arthur
:	is a GOOD character who may NOT send himself on any missions, but he may be chosen for them by others. He also knows who Merlin is. His character is revealed publicly after round 4. King Arthur must protect Merlin at all costs!



Rules Reference
==============================================================

Day 1
----
One random player will be crowned King for the first round! The King will say who they want to go on the upcoming quest. Each quest will have  a different amount of people and different criteria in order to succeed or fail the quest.

Day 2
----
The nominees for the quest will be announced at the beginning of Day 2! Then everyone votes to either __Approve__ or __Reject__ the nominees for the quest. These votes will be public and will be revealed at the end of the day.  If a majority approves, the quest will move forward. If there is a tie or more reject votes than approve, the quest will pass to another player at random. Every subsequent round after will have its King determined by random order.

Day 3
-----
If a quest moves forward, everyone on the quest (in their private messages to the host) will either __Succeed__ or __Fail__ the quest. All it takes is 1 fail for the entire quest to fail unless otherwise stated. These votes will remain anonymous so no one will know who sent them in from the people on the quest. GOOD characters MUST succeed every quest they are on. EVIL characters CAN CHOOSE if they want to succeed or fail the quests they go on. (Yes there are many strategic reasons why an evil player would succeed a quest but I will let ya'll figure that out.)


After a quest is finished, the play reverts back to Day 1 again where the new King nominates a new team to go on the next quest.


**It's best 4/7 quests to win the game! (Succeeded vs Failed Quests)
4 Succeeded quests wins the game for GOOD. 4 Failed quests wins it for EVIL.**


If GOOD wins, EVIL has one more chance at redemption. If after the game, the Assassin guesses the identity of Merlin correctly, EVIL wins! (Therefore, it is very important to not reveal the identity of your character, because you never know who you are talking to or who will find out!)


Also if there are a total of 6 nominated quests rejected throughout the game, EVIL automatically wins!


All communication will take place through WhatsApp. Players will submit approve/reject votes as well as Succeed/Fail votes directly to the host who will reveal results each evening. Votes will be due by 9pm et unless otherwise noted. Players may communicate directly with one another via private message. A community chat will also be available for all players, which will be visible to everyone.


Length of game: Depending on the speed of play, the game could last anywhere between 10-21 days. We could technically play multiple days in one if all players participate and respond at a greater speed. However, out of fairness to life's full schedules and family commitments, the game will default to full 24 hour days, if needed.


Characters are randomly drawn by players and assigned at the beginning of the game. Each player remains the same character throughout the game.

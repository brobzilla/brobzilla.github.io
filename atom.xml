Declan and I went to Lowes one night and we picked out some wood to build our raised boxes.  I decided to go with untreated 2x6s.  I read online that treated wood treated after 2008 would be safe to use for a garden but not really being sure I went ahead and got untreated.  In Mel Bartholomew&rsquo;s book he said that 6&#8221; is all you need for a square foot garden.  We do have plans to fill the boxes with Mel&rsquo;s Mix.  I found that you can buy that online but not sure if I just won&rsquo;t mix my own.  We ran out of time making the boxes so I only got one done.  I will make the other 4x4 raised bed hopfully this weekend.</p>

<h3>Mel&rsquo;s Mix</h3>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>1/3 vermiculite</li>
<li>1/3 peat moss</li>
<li>1/3 compost</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

Teagan and I worked for a few hours in the after noon to remove 4 of the shrubs from the southern side of our house.  As we were pulling them out a few things were going through my mind.  I&rsquo;m getting excited to get this garden started and eat some of the fresh vegetables.  Also the bushes whatever kind they were attracted a lot of bees and hopefully we have a few less around the house.</p>

This is the southern side of my house.  We have a few bushes that grow along that side.  I&rsquo;ll have to pull them to make room for the raised beds.  The thought is that we will do 2 raised beds this year so I won&rsquo;t need to pull the whole row out.  Just 3 or 4 at the end.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve started my garden out by reading <a href="http://www.squarefootgardening.com/learn/all-new-square-foot-gardening-2nd-edition/">Square Foot Gardening</a> by Mel Bartholomew. One of the important things to do in that book is to pick a location for your gardnen. I have a few large trees in my back yard and I&rsquo;m afraid my backyard won&rsquo;t get the 6-8 hours of sunlight needed for a garden. The south facing side of my house should get a plenty of sunshine. There is a tree off in the distance that could cause some early morning shadows but otherwise I think it will be a good location.</p>

<p>We have plans to do raised bed boxes and are thinking two 4x4. This year has been a record year for cold.  I&rsquo;m new to this gardening thing and wanted to get setup as soon as I can.  I will post as things start to come together.</p>

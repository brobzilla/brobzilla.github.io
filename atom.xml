We have a few bushes that grow along that side.  I&rsquo;ll have to pull them to make room for the raised beds.  The thought is that we will do 2 raised beds this year so I won&rsquo;t need to pull the whole row out.  Just 3 or 4 at the end.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve started my garden out by reading <a href="http://www.squarefootgardening.com/learn/all-new-square-foot-gardening-2nd-edition/">Square Foot Gardening</a> by Mel Bartholomew. One of the important things to do in that book is to pick a location for your gardnen. I have a few large trees in my back yard and I&rsquo;m afraid my backyard won&rsquo;t get the 6-8 hours of sunlight needed for a garden. The south facing side of my house should get a plenty of sunshine. There is a tree off in the distance that could cause some early morning shadows but otherwise I think it will be a good location.</p>

<p>We have plans to do raised bed boxes and are thinking two 4x4. This year has been a record year for cold.  I&rsquo;m new to this gardening thing and wanted to get setup as soon as I can.  I will post as things start to come together.</p>
